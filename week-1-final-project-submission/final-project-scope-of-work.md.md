# final-project-scope-of-work

## Questions

1. What aspects of the project are still incomplete?

2. What challenges are you currently facing in your project? What are some specific areas that still need to be investigated?

3. What is your plan to try to overcome these challenges? What resources can you use?

## Write Up

<!--- Final project write up goes here --->

1. I need to add a login feature, add the get, put, and delete features for the leader board, and I will need to touch up the pages a bit once all thats done.

2. The only real challenge was the login feature because I missed the assignment that covered it.

3. Well, just today I went back and completed the assignment, and now have a much better understanding of the subject, so I don't think it will be a challenge anymore.
